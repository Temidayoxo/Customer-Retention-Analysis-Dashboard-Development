# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and retention for a telecommunications company. The goal is to develop a Power BI dashboard that provides key insights for the retention manager, helping to reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.
# Data source 
This dataset was gotten from Deloitte
[02 Churn-Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18931214/02.Churn-Dataset.xlsx)

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks the following KPIs:

1. Churn Rate (%) – Percentage of customers who have left the service.
2. Retention Rate (%) – Percentage of customers retained.
3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – Estimated revenue per customer over their lifetime.
4. Churn Trend Over Time – Monthly trend of customer churn.
5. Churn by Contract Type – Breakdown of churn by contract duration.
6. Churn by Payment Method – Analysis of churn based on payment methods.
7. Support Tickets vs. Churn – Impact of admin/technical issues on churn.


## Visualizations & Insights

 1. Churn Rate & Retention Rate (KPI Cards)
- Provides a quick overview of churn and retention.

2. Churn Trend Over Time (Line Chart)
- Shows how churn fluctuates over different periods.

 3. Churn by Contract Type (Stacked Bar Chart)
- Highlights the risk of churn for different contract durations.

 4. Churn by Payment Method (Pie Chart)
- Identifies whether certain payment methods contribute to higher churn.

 5. Support Tickets vs. Churn (Scatter Plot)
- Analyzes the relationship between customer service interactions and churn.

# Findings & Recommendations
## Findings:
- High churn rate in month-to-month contracts, suggesting the need for customer loyalty programs.
- Electronic check payments show the highest churn, possibly due to billing issues or user preferences.
- Customers with frequent support issues tend to churn more, indicating the need for better customer service strategies.

## Recommendations:
1. Encourage long-term contracts through discounts or incentives.
2. Optimize billing processes to reduce churn from electronic check users.
3. Improve customer support response times to reduce frustration-driven churn.
4. Implement proactive engagement strategies for high-risk customer segments.

  
This project provides a data-driven foundation for improving customer retention strategies.
