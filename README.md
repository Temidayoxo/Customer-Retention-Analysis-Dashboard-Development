3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – Estimated revenue per customer over their lifetime.
4. Churn Trend Over Time – Monthly trend of customer churn.
5. Churn by Contract Type – Breakdown of churn by contract duration.
6. Churn by Payment Method – Analysis of churn based on payment methods.
7. Support Tickets vs. Churn – Impact of admin/technical issues on churn.
